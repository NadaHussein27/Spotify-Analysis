# Spotify-Analysis
End-to-end music data analysis project using Python, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. Includes data cleaning, EDA, visualization, and machine learning to explore factors behind song popularity and streaming performance
Music Trends & Hit Prediction Analysis

This project explores music trends and popularity using a large Spotify-inspired dataset.
The goal is to analyze audio features, identify patterns in hit songs, and evaluate whether machine learning models can predict song success.

Dataset Size:

84,933 tracks

24 features

Project Workflow:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature engineering

Machine learning (classification & regression)

Visualization & storytelling using Power BI, Tableau, and Python

Key Finding:
Audio features alone are insufficient to accurately predict viral hits.
External factors such as marketing, social trends, and artist exposure play a major role in music success.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Power BI, Tableau, Excel
